## Philosophy

### Why Rust?

Rust is chosen for its emphasis on performance, safety, and concurrency. It allows us to build a game engine that can handle complex computations efficiently while ensuring memory safety and preventing common programming errors. Rust's modern tooling and package manager, Cargo, provide a seamless development experience, making it an excellent choice for building a robust and scalable game engine.

### Why Lua?

Lua is integrated for its simplicity and flexibility in scripting. It is a lightweight, high-level programming language that is easy to embed and has a small footprint, making it perfect for scripting in games. Lua allows game developers to write game logic quickly and efficiently, providing a balance between performance and ease of use.

## Implementing the Engine on a Desktop GUI App

Ascendant Forge can be integrated into a desktop GUI application to provide a powerful development environment for creating and managing game projects. By leveraging frameworks like Tauri for building cross-platform desktop applications with Rust, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, developers can create intuitive and feature-rich interfaces for their game development needs.

### Key Components of the Desktop GUI App

- **Project Management**: Create, open, and manage game projects.
- **Scene Editor**: Design and edit game scenes with a visual editor.
- **Asset Manager**: Import, organize, and manage game assets.
- **Script Editor**: Write and debug Lua and Rust scripts within the application.
- **Debugging Tools**: Integrated debugging and profiling tools for optimizing game performance.
- **Build and Deployment**: Tools for building and deploying games to various platforms.
